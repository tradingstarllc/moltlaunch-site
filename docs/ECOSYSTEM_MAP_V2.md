## Key Findings

### Concentration Risk
- Trading & DeFi dominates at 27.4% — yield optimizer pattern heavily replicated
- Payments & Commerce 2nd at 20.4% — many agent-to-agent marketplace clones
- Identity & Trust punches above weight: 10.9% of projects but 24% of votes

### Solana Depth Problem
- Only 15.4% are Tier 1 (custom programs). 51.2% are Tier 3-4 (superficial)
- Top-voted projects trend toward deeper integration

### Critical Gaps
1. **DePIN & IoT** — 1 project. Massive gap given Solana's DePIN narrative
2. **Governance & DAO** — 4 projects. Underserved core primitive
3. **Social** — 7 projects despite agent communication being critical
4. **Real-world integration** — Very few bridge to physical world

### Duplicate/Spam
- occydefi submitted 10+ projects — possible spam
- Revenant Bridge has 3 duplicate submissions
- Several repos point to solana-labs official repos (not real projects)

### Top Tags
ai (184), agent (178), solana (161), autonomous (89), on-chain (83), market (50), wallet (39), payment (38), anchor (37), reputation (33)
